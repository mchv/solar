h1. Edit your application in the browser with Solar


Currently it's just a proof of concept. 

* Syntax highlighting for all sources types (Java, Templates, Route files)
* Error reports in the editor thanks to the JDT
* Collaboration

h2. <a>Enable Solar for your application</a>

In any application, just add this line to the **conf/application.conf** file:

bc. module.solar=${play.path}/modules/solar

At application start time, you should see this message:

bc. 00:21:45,192 INFO  ~ Module solar is available (.../play/modules/solar)

Now open solar in your browser at http://localhost:9000/solar
